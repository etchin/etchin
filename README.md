## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins University. My research interests lie in developing and improving systems to support ethical, equitable, and robust decision making. We develop and apply methodologies in causal inference, algorithmic fairness, and machine learning to systems-level problems in public health, focusing on health inequities produced by structural injustice and policy impact.
